# Orthogonal-Coordinate-System-Distance-Calculator
This C++ program calculates the distance between two points represented by their coordinates in a Cartesian plane. It demonstrates operator overloading for addition and equality, allowing you to perform point operations seamlessly.

## **Features**
-Point Class: Define points with x and y coordinates.
-Distance Calculation: Calculate the distance between two points using the Cartesian distance formula.
-Operator Overloading: Overload operators for addition and equality to simplify point operations.
-User Interaction: Input and display point coordinates interactively.
-Repeatable: Run the program multiple times to calculate distances for different points.

## **How to Use**
1. Enter the coordinates of the first point (x1, y1) and the second point (x2, y2).
2. The program calculates and displays the distance between the two points.
3. It also checks if the points are equal.
